## Distribution of 2X - Y

Given that $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables with normal distributions,
and the corresponding distributions are $X\sim \mathcal{N}(3, 4)$ and $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(1, 4)$,
what is the mean of the distribution of $2X - Y$?
- $E(2X - Y) = 2 \times 3 - 1 = 5$
- $Var(2X - Y) = 2^2 Var(X) + (-1)^2 Var(Y) = 16 + 4 = 20$

## Mutated Offspring

An animal appears normal if it has two normal genes or one normal and one mutated gene.
If it has two mutated genes, it appears mutated.
Any given animal has a 50% chance to contribute either of its genes to its offspring.

Animals A and B are parents of C and D. C and D are parents of E.
A and B both have one normal and one mutated gene.
We know C and D both appear normal.

What is the probability that **D has one normal and one mutated** gene given that E appears normal?

- total 4 cases : 2 nor, nor * mut, mut * nor, 2 mut
- P(normal)
  - P(nor * mut) = 1/2
  - P(2 nor) = 1/4
- P(E = nor)
  - P(C = 2 nor) * P(D = 2 nor) = 1/16 -> E always normal
  - P(C = 2 nor) * P(D = nor & mut) = 1/8 -> E always normal
  - P(C = nor & mut) * P(D = 2 nor) = 1/8 -> E always normal
  - P(C = nor & mut) * P(D = nor & mut) = 1/4 -> E to be normal : 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16
- P(C = nor, D = nor, E = nor) = 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 3/16 = 1/2
- P(D = nor & mut | E = nor) = (1/8 + 3/16) / 1/2 = 5/8

# Python

Youâ€™re given two dataframes.
One contains information about addresses and the other contains relationships between various cities and states.
Write a function complete_address to create a single dataframe with complete addresses in the format of street, city, state, zip code.

```
import pandas as pd

def complete_address(df_addresses: pd.DataFrame, df_cities: pd.DataFrame):
    df_addresses[['street', 'city', 'zip code']] = df_addresses['address'].str.split(', ', expand=True) # expand the result into a DataFrame
    df = df_addresses.merge(df_cities, on='city')
    df['address'] = df[['street', 'city', 'state', 'zip code']].apply(
        lambda x: ', '.join(x), axis=1
    )
    
    return df[['address']]
```
